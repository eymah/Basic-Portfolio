    <body> About Me </body>

        <div> Hello, my name is Eymah Nuzhat and I am from Lahore, Pakistan. I moved to America 11 years ago and I am currently living in Bellevue WA with my husband and three extremely naughty children. 

              I did my undergrad in Fine Art with majors in painting and yes, I love to paint during my free time. Other than painting I love to hike, take long walks and read books.  </div>
